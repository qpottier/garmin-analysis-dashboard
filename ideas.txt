Journalier : impact de la charge de l'entrainement sur l'organisme / récupération

Calculate Time in Each Zone for Every Activity
This is where our records table becomes incredibly powerful. For each activity:

We'll query all the heart_rate data points from the records table.

For every second of the activity, we'll classify the heart rate into one of the 5 zones we just defined.

We'll then sum the total time (in minutes) you spent in each zone.

Step 3: Calculate the Zone-Weighted Load Score (zTRIMP)
Now we assign a multiplier to each zone that reflects its physiological demand. The higher the zone, the higher the weight.

Zone 1 Multiplier: 1

Zone 2 Multiplier: 2

Zone 3 Multiplier: 3

Zone 4 Multiplier: 4

Zone 5 Multiplier: 5

The formula for the activity's load score will be:

Activity Load Score = (Minutes in Z1 * 1) + (Minutes in Z2 * 2) + (Minutes in Z3 * 3) + (Minutes in Z4 * 4) + (Minutes in Z5 * 5)
